Many adults on the autism spectrum without intellectual disabilities in Massachusetts have difficulties finding services to help them. 
There is a lack of awareness about such existing providers and where to look them up. People have trouble finding the resources easily due to the lack of a centralized system that has the information about all the existing services and their providers, all in one place. 
This project sets about creating a prototype centralized database and web interface to unify all these resources. The project uses SQL and JavaScript, using MySQL to run the database with React.js and Node.js holding the client user interface.
